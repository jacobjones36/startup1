My dad has been the coach of the soccer team at my high school since I was a freshman there. Ever since we remember the high school has never had an athletic page for any of the sports that actually works and is used. I want to create a website that someday my dad can actually use to get information out and someday build a better program there. I want it to be accessible by him and other coaches/admin to edit the schedule and other things that would be useful for an athletics page. I want it to be very user friendly so it is appealing for people to look at and easy to find the information they are looking for. I will use html to make very basic. The css to make it beautiful. And the javascript to make it so they can update the information on it as well as a login feature to allow only certain people to access the admin features.
